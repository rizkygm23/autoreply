This approach turns a once prohibitive infrastructure hurdle into an inclusive, permissionless opportunity.\n\n•  No Cloud Dependency: \nBreak free from reliance on centralized providers like AWS.\n\n•  No Gatekeepers: \nParticipate without needing costly intermediaries.\n\n•  True Decentralization: \n\n@cysic_xyz\n trustless validation ensures your computational work is verified transparently by the network.\n\nThe outcome? \nA ZK proving layer that’s faster, more secure, and genuinely community driven, leveling the playing field for all.\n\nProof of Compute: (More Than a Vision)\nThis isn’t just a concept it’s a live, operational system. Cysic’s Phase III testnet already supports over 118,000 provers and 200,000 verifiers, generating more than 7 million ZK proofs daily. Powered by custom ASICs delivering 1.3 million Keccak operations per second, the network is setting new benchmarks for ZK efficiency.\n\nThe Future of ZK Is Here\nWith tools like ZK Air and ZK Pro simplifying node setup, and yield bearing $CGT tokens plus governance features on the horizon, \n\n@cysic_xyz\n is building a vibrant, inclusive compute ecosystem. Proof of Compute isn’t just a tagline it’s a working reality that lets you earn by contributing to real ZK workloads.\nThis is the dawn of decentralized, community powered ZK infrastructure.\n This is \n@cysic_xyz\n.

My latest Cysic post took me six hours to curate not because I’m short of ideas, but because I always bring my A game. I study what will actually bring real users into the Cysic ecosystem, not just to the same recycled audience who have been here with us forever.\n\nThe Kaito algorithm is programmed to mainly push posts from those who keep selling whitepaper ideas over and over, or brag about their reputation on Kaito just like 90% of their so called smart followers and “Inner CT.” They compete for project leaderboards but forget that a project requires much more from them.\n\nThey’ve sold the project idea to the same Kaito farmers, people counted as users, but in reality are disguised airdrop hunters. To me, this is a repeated circle. And if Cysic will agree to work with me, we can break this circle and bring real world sustainable utility to Web3.\n\nAs a smart follower, if you can’t secure new deals for a project you’re ranking for, then you’re nothing more than an airdrop hunter like everyone else most of whom care less about the project and more about taking all the rewards for themselves. Yuhu and his gang know this game well.\n\nThe version of posts I repeatedly see on my TL is disgusting. How do these posts help a project progress? No marketing strategy. No pull for new investors. No securing of top deals. Just endless “I’m on Cysic leaderboard 7 days” posts and the same lines repeated countless times about Cysic. For God’s sake it’s boring.\n\nI don’t know exactly how to go about it, but I think it’s time Cysic understands they might suffer the same fate as other projects if they don’t act now. The same people who farmed Infinit Labs will farm Cysic in no time. There’s no coordination in Kaito’s system everyone acts however they want, and still ranks the leaderboard without doing anything.\n\nWithout breaking this circle and introducing this meta to the world not to farm rewards but to consume them Web3 will always remain a branch under Web2, which is a total shame to us all.\n\nThis is why I told \n@cysic_xyz\n they should secure a gaming platform deal. Their services are needed. If Sony or Nvidia is too big for now, they can start with mobile gamers first, then transition. Their ZK tech and hardware can take them far if they’re willing to listen to advisors like me and others who bring real world value to the project.",

What would \n@cysic_xyz\n enable if they speed proving??\n\nHere are 5 applications Cysic could help bring to life\n\n1. 𝗜𝗗𝗘𝗡𝗧𝗜𝗧𝗬 𝗩𝗘𝗥𝗜𝗙𝗜𝗖𝗔𝗧𝗜𝗢𝗡 \nZKPs can be used to verify a user's identity without having to reveal personal information, such as citizenship or age, to the verifier. Once again privacy is saved\n\nYou can say bye to KYC through this.\n\n2. 𝗔𝗟𝗧𝗘𝗥𝗡𝗔𝗧𝗜𝗩𝗘 𝗧𝗢 𝗣𝗔𝗦𝗦𝗪𝗢𝗥𝗗\nZKPs can replace passwords and other authentication methods, allowing users to prove their identity without transmitting sensitive data. \nAll you need is a ZKP that you own this account \n\n3. 𝗣𝗥𝗜𝗩𝗔𝗧𝗘 𝗧𝗥𝗔𝗡𝗦𝗔𝗖𝗧𝗜𝗢𝗡𝗦 \nZKPs are used in cryptocurrencies to make transactions private. An example is Zcash that enables private transactions where transaction details and user identities are obscured. Your balance, prior transactions and all are masked\n\nZcash does this by using ZK-SNARK.\n\n4. 𝗩𝗢𝗧𝗜𝗡𝗚 𝗦𝗬𝗦𝗧𝗘𝗠 \nZKP  can be used to create highly secure and verifiable voting mechanisms that enable individuals to cast votes without compromising their identity or revealing who they voted for. \n\nUsers don’t need to provide documents that expose personal info to prove eligibility like they do in web 2, all they need is a ZKP and they’re good to go\n\n5. 𝗔𝗥𝗧𝗜𝗙𝗜𝗖𝗜𝗔𝗟 𝗜𝗡𝗧𝗘𝗟𝗟𝗜𝗚𝗘𝗡𝗖𝗘\nZK proofs allow AI systems to provide proof that a prediction or decision was made according to a specific model, without revealing the full model’s parameters or proprietary logic.\n\nIf your chat gpt says it’s running on GPT-5, ZKPs can help prove that it is true and it’s not lying when it’s actually giving you data from GPT-4\n\nThis help solidify the trust in data presented by AIs\n\n\nThese are few of the use case that Cysic could help bring to life with their fast ZK proof generation.\n\nDo you now see Cysic vision, Good tek? Yeah it 100% is. \n\nGmsor Cysic family!",

Cysic isn’t just another project; it’s a new standard for proof generation in Web3.\n \nTraditionally, proofs in blockchain have been:\n\n- Slow → high latency verification.\n \n- Costly → consuming resources that limit scalability.\n \n- Complex → accessible only to technical elites.\n \nCysic changes this by introducing a high-performance, AI-accelerated proof generation layer that makes Web3 more powerful:\n \n- Speed → near real-time proof creation for scalability.\n \n- Accessibility → empowering builders and communities, not just specialists.\n \n- Efficiency → reducing costs without compromising security.\n \nThe real breakthrough is this: Proofs are no longer a hidden technicality. With Cysic, they become a *core primitive* enabling scalable DeFi, AI-integrated apps, and a new trust layer for the decentralized internet.\n \n Cysic transforms proofs into an engine of trust,  pushing Web3 from a network of transactions into a network of guaranteed truths.\n \nThis is why Cysic isn’t just building technology; it’s redefining the very foundation of Web3 trust. And for builders, researchers, and community members, this is the time to align with that vision.\n \n Explore more here: [https://staking.succinct.xyz](https://staking.succinct.xyz)\n \nThe future of Web3 won’t be defined by speculation. It will be defined by *trust at scale*, and that’s exactly what Cysic is delivering.",

Cysic expands this vision by transforming GPUs, ASICs, and other high-performance resources into modular, yield-generating instruments for zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs). The implications are significant: hardware is no longer simply a sunk cost, but a productive economic unit in a decentralized financial system.\n\nThis conceptual shift aligns with the broader trend of \"financialization of everything\" in Web3. Where DeFi unlocked capital efficiency by allowing idle tokens to generate yield, Cysic applies the same logic to computational resources. Idle GPUs that would otherwise sit in data centers or personal rigs can now participate in a global proving economy, where liquidity in computation is just as valuable as liquidity in capital. The impact is a twofold revolution: democratization of access to compute-based revenue streams, and the acceleration of ZK scalability by tapping into vast, underutilized global hardware.\n\n#ComputeFi #Web3Infrastructure #ZKProofs\n\n@inspectxyz",

The specific content is as follows:\n\nI. ZKA6 and Doge Box Related Information\n\n(I) ZKA6 Project Progress\n\nThe design and coding of ZKA6 has completed its second public iteration. Subsequent adjustments and optimizations will be made based on community consensus on the wiki and algorithm, as well as market demand. If market demand for ZKA6 is strong, chip tape-out is expected to begin soon or next year.\n\n(II) Doge Box Product Details\n\nFunctional Positioning: Doge Box is primarily used for mining Dutch coin or night coin, while also supporting VK proof verification. Its correlation with ZKA6 is relatively low.\n\nR&D and Sales: Currently, only a sample model (running quietly) is available. Comprehensive internal testing is underway (including metrics such as computing power, noise, and power consumption). It will be integrated with the Cysic super app and the Sati network in the future. The sales page is expected to launch a few days before TGE (token generation event), with shipping around TGE.\n\nII. Computing Power Abstraction Planning\nThe company plans to first abstract GPU computing power into tradable share assets, allowing users to obtain returns by investing in these shares. Currently, the quantification methods and return calculation mechanisms for computing power abstraction are still being explored. Simultaneously, integration with Ethereum's e7 technology is being considered, allowing investors to obtain e7 tokens as a reward by participating in \"shadow block proof + construction.\" Related plans are being negotiated and advanced with the Ethereum Foundation.",

        "reply": "III. Partners and Technology Integration\nExisting Cooperation: Cooperation with some ZooKeeper projects (such as Success and Bonus) is underway, along with collaboration with AI projects to explore verifiable AI applications.\n\nFuture Direction: Going forward, the focus will be on collaborating with non-Zk blockchain projects, integrating ZooKeeper technology into their products to enhance privacy protection or scalability, promote the mainstreaming of ZooKeeper technology in the blockchain field, and further strengthen its decentralized characteristics.\n\nIV. ZKA6 Verification Phase and Commercial Deployment\nCurrently, ZKA6 has not yet entered the testing or mass production preparation stages. The company will carefully plan the use of funds, prioritizing market demand assessment—currently, the greatest demand comes from Ecevian real-time proof scenarios (partner Seexing has implemented this function using 1650/90 Q cards; although costs are controllable, there is still room for optimization). If ZKA6 enters mass production, it will significantly improve the cost-effectiveness of this scenario, but chip tape-out, testing, and mass production preparation require substantial investment, and further progress will depend on market feedback.\n\nV. Community Rewards and Benefits Policy\n\n(I) Early Supporter Rewards\n\nCube holders: will receive exclusive benefits (such as priority access before the mainnet/TGE). The team is working on related incentive programs to reward their long-term patience and support.\n\nOther early supporters: including testnet participants and active community contributors (Yappers), will receive exclusive surprise rewards. Unlike some projects where airdrops have been ineffective, the company will genuinely reward early supporters.",

The mobile apps for both iOS and Android are planned to go live at the same time as mainnet, and the DogeBox sales page will open at TGE with delivery synced to the mainnet timeline.\n\nYappers will continue to be tracked through weekly snapshots, and the team will announce the final snapshot date ahead of time. Discord role holders can also expect rewards, though different roles will count differently.\n\nAll exchange listings for \n@cysic_xyz\n have been approved already. The Checker page is finished, but the smart contract audits still need a bit more time. The team also mentioned that several new collaborations with ZK and AI projects are coming, and Succinct stakers who supported the Cysic prover will be included as well.\n\nMainnet and TGE are still aimed for this month, but the exact date hasn’t been confirmed yet.",

That is what \n@cysic_xyz\n is. An unfolding story that seems written long before we arrived, yet still waits for us to give it meaning.\n\nFrom the first spark of curiosity to the growing hum of a global community, Cysic has carried the energy of something inevitable. Not rushed. Not forced. Just right. Like a door we were always meant to open.\n\nEvery phase, every breakthrough, every challenge met with resilience has shaped Cysic into more than a project, it has become a movement. A place where computation meets ambition, where vision meets proof, and where people who believe in the future gather as if drawn by an invisible thread.\n\nAnd in this beginning, there is a feeling, subtle but powerful. A sense that we are standing at the start of a journey that will redefine the limits of what is possible. A feeling that we did not stumble here by accident. That somehow, in all the noise of the digital world, we found something that resonates with who we are and who we hope to become.\n\nCysic is not just rising\nit is aligning.\nWith the future.\nWith innovation.\nWith us.\n\nA beginning that feels like destiny.",

That is what \n@cysic_xyz\n is. An unfolding story that seems written long before we arrived, yet still waits for us to give it meaning.\n\nFrom the first spark of curiosity to the growing hum of a global community, Cysic has carried the energy of something inevitable. Not rushed. Not forced. Just right. Like a door we were always meant to open.\n\nEvery phase, every breakthrough, every challenge met with resilience has shaped Cysic into more than a project, it has become a movement. A place where computation meets ambition, where vision meets proof, and where people who believe in the future gather as if drawn by an invisible thread.\n\nAnd in this beginning, there is a feeling, subtle but powerful. A sense that we are standing at the start of a journey that will redefine the limits of what is possible. A feeling that we did not stumble here by accident. That somehow, in all the noise of the digital world, we found something that resonates with who we are and who we hope to become.\n\nCysic is not just rising\nit is aligning.\nWith the future.\nWith innovation.\nWith us.\n\nA beginning that feels like destiny.",

Our specialized proving backend is designed to drastically reduce proving time, lower costs, and deliver high throughput without compromising on trustlessness or performance guarantees.\n\nCysic’s role is to:\n\ntransform heavy zkML workloads into fast, scalable pipelines,\n\nremove the computational bottlenecks that limit on-chain AI,\n\nprovide production-grade proving performance,\n\nand ensure NOYA’s AI agents can operate smoothly across multiple chains.\n\nThis partnership is built around one idea: Cysic must be the technical engine that lifts zkML from experimental to production-ready. By handling the proof generation layer end-to-end, Cysic enables NOYA to focus on what it does best building intelligent agents for cross-chain liquidity management.\n\nTogether, we’re pushing the boundaries of what AI on-chain can become and Cysic is proud to power the core infrastructure that makes this possible.",

    "caption": "I’m excited to announce that \n@cysic_xyz\n is partnering with NOYA, taking on a central role in powering the next generation of zkML infrastructure.\n\nIn this collaboration, cysic is responsible for accelerating the most computationally demanding part of NOYA’s stack zk proof generation. Our specialized proving backend is designed to drastically reduce proving time, lower costs, and deliver high throughput without compromising on trustlessness or performance guarantees.\n\nCysic’s role is to:\n\ntransform heavy zkML workloads into fast, scalable pipelines,\n\nremove the computational bottlenecks that limit on-chain AI,\n\nprovide production-grade proving performance,\n\nand ensure NOYA’s AI agents can operate smoothly across multiple chains.\n\nThis partnership is built around one idea: Cysic must be the technical engine that lifts zkML from experimental to production-ready. By handling the proof generation layer end-to-end, Cysic enables NOYA to focus on what it does best building intelligent agents for cross-chain liquidity management.\n\nTogether, we’re pushing the boundaries of what AI on-chain can become and Cysic is proud to power the core infrastructure that makes this possible.",
